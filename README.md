# First Assignment:
Inside the html folder there is the documentation generated for the second assignment of research track 1.
To visualize the documentation, you can download from this repository the folder 'html' and then open with your browser 'index.html'.

# Second Assignment:
The .ipynb [file](https://github.com/Matteoforni1/RT2_assignment1/blob/main/Assignment_2_RT2.ipynb) contains the code for the second assignment.
The cells must be run in order.
Moreover, before start running the cells, you should launch the simulation environment in the package assignment_2_2022 (not the other one, which is the original second assignment).

# Third Assignment:
The .pdf [file](https://github.com/Matteoforni1/RT2_assignment1/blob/main/Report_RT2_Statistics.pdf) contains the report for the third assignment.
